<color=yellow>Welcome to Improved Transport Manager, the ITM!</color>

This mod intends to be a replacement to the both old IPT2 and TLM. Here are some of features already done in this mod:

- Copy/paste vehicle selection between lines
- Change vehicle capacity
- Change vehicle cost per passenger
- New line map with extended information for stops and vehicles
<color=yellow>- Express lines for Bus, Tram and Trolleybus</color>
- Vehicles never get back to depot with passengers
- When express lines is on for modal, the vehicles only will get back to depot in a terminal stop
- Select any stop as terminal stop (the first stop always is)
- Change the internal line number
<color=yellow>- Create lines for ship and airplanes (experimental)</color>
- Reports for lines, stops and vehicles
- Change line ticket price
- Manually disable the line without deleting it
- Replaced completely the vanilla line listing window to always point to ITM window
- Export/Import default city settings
- Integrations to Custom Data Mod to setup the line logo
- Near lines (from TLM)
- Name stops of a line based on one-shot near buildings/district/park/road (not automatic)
- Give initial stop name linked to a near Public Transport building or to a road if none is near
- Change stops names to a custom value
- Autoname lines based on terminals
- Express circular lines (that NEVER stops in any stop if there's nothing to do)
- Custom line string identifier (from TLM - also to integrate with Write Everywhere)

<b>What is missing but are planned to release version 1:</b>

- Autocolor (from TLM)
- Integrations to Write Everywhere to setup line destinations to terminal
- Depot selection
- Fares settings groups (expert mode only) (replacing old "prefixes" settings from TLM)
- Budget settings groups (expert mode only) (replacing old "prefixes" settings from TLM)
- Tickets settings groups (expert mode only) (replacing old "prefixes" settings from TLM)
- Fare per hour (expert mode only) (from TLM)
- Budget per hour (expert mode only) (from TLM)
- Lines settings by weekday (expert mode only)
- Vehicle context information (from IPT2)
- Customize outside connection lines from train buildings (expert mode only) (from TLM)

<b>What is missing and <color=red>will not</color> be added to ITM:</b>

- Automatic autoname stops from buildings, addresses and districts (from TLM)
<color=yellow>Cause:</color> Very heavy to handle, it was causing the TLM to eat a lot of FPS when compared to IPT2 as example
<color=green>Solution:</color> Name the stops manually. The autoname based on stops will still be available. As well, an option to rename manually at once all stops of a line will be available, what could help on it.
